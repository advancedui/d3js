<h2>Introduction</h2>

D3.js stands for Data Driven Documents. It's a very comprehensive library which provides many tools for data-based calculations and document manipulations. It also handles (and that's one of its strong points) many of the math needed for the visualization of data. D3 has a steep learning curve, but once you experiment with it and manage to do simple visualization of some kind of data; the learning process will become much more compelling and interesting. That's the purpose of this post.

D3 handles any kind of document, be it HTML or SVG, and it's not exclusively used to create graphics. That being said, D3 lends itself very well for manipulation of shapes and graphical objects based on static and dynamic data. As such, D3 makes it possible to create very appealing documents.

SVG is one type of document which is often being used with D3. With SVG one can create graphical entities much like creating and styling HTML elements. In this article we will use SVG to visualize our data.

D3 is not a monolithic framework that seeks to provide every conceivable feature. Instead, D3 solves the crux of the problem: efficient manipulation of documents based on data. This avoids proprietary representation and affords extraordinary flexibility, exposing the full capabilities of web standards such as HTML, SVG, and CSS. With minimal overhead, D3 is extremely fast, supporting large datasets and dynamic behaviors for interaction and animation. D3â€™s functional style allows code reuse through a diverse collection of official and community-developed modules.
